# Web UI for ChatGPT

https://assistant.bloat.app

Ask questions from Open AIâ€™s ChatGPT `gpt-3.5-turbo` engine

## ðŸ¤” Why?

### Compared to chat.openai.com
- Token-based cost, instead of flat 20$/mo
- No more logouts - OpenAI API key is stored in `localStorage`
- Can be added to the phoneâ€™s home screen or installed on your computer as a Chrome app
- OpenAIâ€™s API policy says your prompts wonâ€™t be used for developing, unlike in the playground

### Compared to many other ChatGPT wrappers
- Requests go directly from the browser to OpenAI â€“ no backend server
- PWA support
- Different UI design

## ðŸšš In the future
- Customize the assistantâ€™s behind-the-scenes brief
- Search old chats with GPT embeddings (meaning your search words donâ€™t need to be an exact match)
- Speak your messages using the Whisper API

## ðŸ‘€ Hidden features
You can open the assistant with an initial prompt if you want to make integrations into other apps. Example: [https://assistant.bloat.app/#q=hello%20there](https://assistant.bloat.app/#q=hello%20there)
