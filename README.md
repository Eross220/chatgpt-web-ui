# Web UI for Open AI

https://question.bloat.app

- Ask questions from Open AI’s GPT-3 `davinci-003` engine
- No more daily logouts from the playground - OpenAI API key is stored in `localStorage`
- Can be added to the phone’s home screen
- Token-based cost, instead of flat 20$/mo
- No word-by-word output throttling – get all text immediately after generation

## In the future
- Install on your computer as a light-weight Chrome app
- Customize the assistant’s brief in the prompt
