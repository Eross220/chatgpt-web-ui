# Contributing

You have discovered this page. Maybe you will also discover bugs or missing features. You can tell me about them in the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/felixbade/chatgpt-web-ui/issues).

## Philosophy
- OpenAI has made the best chat AI API. This tools makes the best human-interface for that.
- ”Getting started” UX is insanely important.
- User ergonomy is insanely valuable.
- The user should be in control, not the platform.
- New features need a UI, which is distracting to core features. New features must be more valuable than the clutter and complexity they are adding.
- Let’s show the world just how much is possible with little.

## Feature requests
My goal is to make this app a fully equipped productivity tool, while keeping the UX and codebase super simple. The bigger the idea pool of new features, the better choices I can make when prioritizing development.
- Please explain **why** your feature would be useful for you. **What kind of problem would it solve?**
- If you find an existing issue that describes your feature – or a very similar feature (as in it doesn’t make sense to implement both) – feel free to add your use-case/needs to the comments. This helps me understand which features are the most needed.
- If you are not sure how exactly your feature should be implemented, feel free to describe different possibilities (even obviously bad ones), and let me do the decision. I might also get inspiration from your descriptions and do something slightly different.
- It is also okay to request very big features – I might get ideas from it even if I don’t implement it directly.

See [existing feature requests](https://github.com/felixbade/chatgpt-web-ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) for inspiration.

## Bug reports
I want to make this tool rock solid and ergonomic, but I can’t test all scenarios. The first step of fixing bugs is finding them, and the second is describing what the bug is about. You can do these without touching the code. The better your report, the more likely it is that I fix it quickly.

- Please explain how it behaves, and how you would expect it to behave.
- For UI bugs, please include a screenshot that contains the problem area (remember to hide your API key)
- For errors, please include the error message
- No bug is too small to report, because smaller bugs are often easier to fix.
- Some bugs are debatable, but in general, if it makes you think ”oh, this doesn’t seem right”, it’s a bug.

See [existing bug reports](https://github.com/felixbade/chatgpt-web-ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+) for inspiration.

If you are not sure whether your issue is a bug report or a feature request, don’t worry, I will add an adequate label (or just fix it).

## Pull requests
Please make an issue about your improvement before submitting any code. You might also find it more convenient to just make your own fork, because then you don’t need my approval for changes. I care more about code base consistency and UI simplicity than feature-richness.
